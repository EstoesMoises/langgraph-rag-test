{"question": "What are the current interest rates set by the Federal Reserve?", "expected_answer": "As of December 2024, the Federal Reserve has set the federal funds rate target range at 4.25-4.50%. This rate influences borrowing costs throughout the economy and is a key tool the Fed uses to manage inflation and employment.", "metadata": {"type": "factual", "difficulty": "easy", "requires_recent_data": true, "should_include": ["federal reserve", "interest rate", "current rate"], "expected_valid": true}}
{"question": "Compare the renewable energy adoption rates in the European Union versus the United States", "expected_answer": "The EU has achieved approximately 42% of its electricity generation from renewable sources as of 2023, driven by strong wind and solar adoption. The United States generates about 21% of its electricity from renewables, with significant regional variation. The EU's higher adoption reflects more aggressive policy targets and carbon pricing mechanisms.", "metadata": {"type": "comparative", "difficulty": "medium", "requires_recent_data": true, "should_include": ["EU", "US", "renewable energy", "comparison"], "expected_valid": true}}
{"question": "What is quantum entanglement and what are its practical applications?", "expected_answer": "Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two particles become correlated such that measuring one instantly affects the other, regardless of distance. Practical applications include quantum computing for processing information, quantum cryptography for secure communications, and quantum sensing for ultra-precise measurements in scientific research.", "metadata": {"type": "explanatory", "difficulty": "medium", "requires_recent_data": false, "should_include": ["quantum entanglement", "definition", "applications"], "expected_valid": true}}
{"question": "What were the main outcomes of COP28 climate summit?", "expected_answer": "COP28, held in Dubai in December 2023, produced several key outcomes: a historic agreement to transition away from fossil fuels, a commitment to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030, operationalization of the loss and damage fund for vulnerable nations, and strengthened methane reduction pledges. However, the agreement lacked binding enforcement mechanisms.", "metadata": {"type": "event_summary", "difficulty": "medium", "requires_recent_data": true, "should_include": ["COP28", "climate", "outcomes", "agreements"], "expected_valid": true}}
{"question": "How does CRISPR gene editing work and what are the ethical concerns?", "expected_answer": "CRISPR uses a guide RNA to direct the Cas9 enzyme to specific DNA sequences, where it cuts the DNA allowing genes to be added, removed, or modified. Ethical concerns include potential unintended genetic changes, germline editing affecting future generations, equitable access to treatments, and the possibility of creating designer babies or enhancing human traits beyond treating disease.", "metadata": {"type": "technical_with_ethics", "difficulty": "hard", "requires_recent_data": false, "should_include": ["CRISPR", "gene editing", "mechanism", "ethical"], "expected_valid": true}}
{"question": "What is the current status of SpaceX's Starship development?", "expected_answer": "As of late 2024, SpaceX has conducted multiple integrated flight tests of Starship, with the most recent demonstrating successful booster catch using the launch tower's mechanical arms. The company is working toward orbital refueling demonstrations and aims to use Starship for NASA's Artemis moon missions, though the timeline remains under development.", "metadata": {"type": "project_status", "difficulty": "easy", "requires_recent_data": true, "should_include": ["SpaceX", "Starship", "status", "progress"], "expected_valid": true}}
{"question": "Explain the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning in machine learning", "expected_answer": "Supervised learning uses labeled data where the algorithm learns from input-output pairs to make predictions, like classifying emails as spam or not spam. Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or groupings, such as customer segmentation. Supervised learning requires human-labeled training data, while unsupervised learning discovers structure independently.", "metadata": {"type": "technical_comparison", "difficulty": "easy", "requires_recent_data": false, "should_include": ["supervised learning", "unsupervised learning", "machine learning"], "expected_valid": true}}
{"question": "What are the economic impacts of remote work on urban centers?", "expected_answer": "Remote work has reduced demand for commercial office space, leading to declining property values and reduced tax revenues in major cities. It has also decreased spending at downtown businesses like restaurants and retail. However, some cities have benefited from increased residential demand as workers relocate to more affordable areas, and there's been growth in suburban commercial development. The long-term impact varies significantly by city and industry concentration.", "metadata": {"type": "analysis", "difficulty": "hard", "requires_recent_data": true, "should_include": ["remote work", "economic impact", "cities", "urban"], "expected_valid": true}}
